300 lines Python code, PyGame, Pipenv, Survive


## Environment Instruction
1. Install Python3

2. Assume you are a MacOS/Linux user, install Pipenv in TERMINAL(Command Line Tool) :
  
  `brew install pipenv`
  
   (If you have it already, you may upgrade): 
  
  `brew upgrade pipenv`
  
3. The following code will do:
    1, create a new Python env with Python 3.7.x;
    2, automatically install required Python module(PyGame);
    3, enter the env:

  `pipenv --three`
  `pipenv install`
  `pipenv shell`
  
  Guide of how to use [PipEnv](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/#yes-i-need-to-distribute-my-code-as-a-package).

  
    Behind the scene: "pipenv shell" will search for existing Pipfile and download all modules automatically in your new environment.

4. Once everything is installed, open your terminal in the directory that includes the game file:
  
    ```
    #python 2D_AirplaneGame.py
    ```
