# 2D_Airplane_Shooting_Game

## Content 
300 lines Python code, PyGame, Pipenv, Survive

## Environment Instruction
1. Pull the repository - Init & Clone:
  Learn how to pull a [GitHub Repo](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository). It is simple!
  I prefer to use PyCharm to clone the repository directly because you can open Terminal in it right away.

2. Assume you are a MacOS/Linux user, install Pipenv in TERMINAL(Command Line Tool) :
  
  `brew install pipenv`
  
   (If you have it already, you may upgrade): 
  
  `brew upgrade pipenv`
  
3. Go to desired directory and setup your Python Pipenv there by typing, assuming you have Python 3.7.1:

  `pipenv --three`
  `pipenv shell`
  
  What Happen behind the scene: "pipenv shell" will search for Pipfile and download all modules automatically in your new environment.
  
  Guide of how to use [PipEnv](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/#yes-i-need-to-distribute-my-code-as-a-package).
  
5. Once everything is installed, open your terminal in the directory that includes the game file: 
  
  `python 2D_AirplaneGame.py`

## Play & Survive
Up/down/left/right for movement, space for shooting.
